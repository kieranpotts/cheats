= Outputs

Often, you want Terraform to output some data someplace, so you can review it later. This is particularly important when Terraform is run in a pipeline. For example, you might want to know the IP addresses of newly created services, so you can ping them.

You define outputs in an `output.tf` file. Example:

[source]
----
output "instance_id" {
  description = "ID of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.app_instance.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP address of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.app_instance.public_ip
}
----

The values will be captured and printed to the standard output when `terraform apply` is run:

[source]
----
Outputs:

instance_id = "i-07bca4e61ccba1542"
instance_public_ip = "52.56.205.129"
----

If you want to see the outputs from the last `apply` operation, run `terraform output`.
