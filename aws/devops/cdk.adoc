= Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

This is an open source *software development framework* that enables you to model your cloud resources using familiar programming languages: TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

It is a higher-level abstraction over AWS CloudFormation, which is a *declarative* way to define your infrastructure as code. CDK is *imperative*, meaning you can use programming constructs like loops and conditionals to define your infrastructure.

The main use case is to avoid needing to learn CloudFormation's proprietary syntax!
