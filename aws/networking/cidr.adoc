= CIDR range

When you create a VPC, you will create an IPv4 *CIDR range*.

CIDR is an acronym for *Classless Inter-Domain Routing*. A CIDR range is a notation that specifies a range of IP addresses. It is used to define the range of IP addresses that is reserved for use by resources within the VPC.

It is strongly RECOMMENDED that each VPC has a unique CIDR range, and that there be no overlap with the CIDR ranges of other VPCs in the same region (and associated with the same account). Overlapping CIDR blocks can create routing problems for some services, like AWS Transit Gateway.

Resources launched into a VPC can be assigned IP addresses from the VPC's CIDR range, for the purpose of routing traffic.

The CIDR range notation looks like this:

* 10.0.0.0/24
* 10.0.0.0/16
* 10.0.0.0/8

The digits between the dots are octets, ie. 8-bit integers between 0 and 254.

The number after the slash is the number of bits that are fixed in the range. So if you see `/24` on the end, this means that the first three octets (8 + 8 + 8 = 24) are fixed, and the last octet can be any number between 0 and 254. If you see `/16` on the end, it means the first two octets are locked, and `/8` means only the first octet is locked.

|===
|CIDR range |Min IPv4 |Max IPv4

|10.0.0.0/24
|10.0.0.1
|10.0.0.254

|10.0.0.0/16
|10.0.0.1
|10.0.255.254

|10.0.0.0/8
|10.0.0.1
|10.255.255.254
|===

Inputting `10.0.0.0/16` for your CIDR range will give you 65,536 possible IP addresses, in the range 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.254, which will be more than sufficient for most networking requirements.
