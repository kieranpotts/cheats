= Virtual Private Clouds (VPC)

This section introduces basic networking concepts in AWS, through a series of practical steps that will build a virtual private cloud that looks like this:

We start with VPCs.

A *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)* is like a private network to isolate a group of resources that sit within it.

When you create a VPC, you will create an IPv4 *CIDR range*. A CIDR range is a notation that specifies a range of IP addresses. Examples:

* 10.0.0.0/24
* 10.0.0.0/16
* 10.0.0.0/8

Each octet (the digits between the dots) can be between 0 and 254 â€“ an 8-bit integer. The number after the slash is the number of bits that are fixed in the range. So if you see `/24` on the end, this means that the first three octets (8 + 8 + 8 = 24) are fixed, and the last octet can be any number between 0 and 254. If you see `/16` on the end, it means the first two octets are locked, and `/8` means only the first octet is locked.

|===
|CIDR range |Min IPv4 |Max IPv4

|10.0.0.0/24
|10.0.0.1
|10.0.0.254

|10.0.0.0/16
|10.0.0.1
|10.0.255.254

|10.0.0.0/8
|10.0.0.1
|10.255.255.254
|===

Inputting `10.0.0.0/16` for your CIDR range will give you 65,536 possible IP addresses, in the range 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.254, which will be more than sufficient for most networking requirements.
