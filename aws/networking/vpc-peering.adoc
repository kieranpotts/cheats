= VPC peering

This is a way to get our VPCs to communicate with each other using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

VPC peering can be used to connect VPCs in different regions, and even in different AWS accounts.

For this to work, each VPC must have a separate block of IP addresses. This is why it is important for CIDR ranges to not overlap with one another.

VPC connections are not transitive (ie. you can't route traffic to one VPC via another VPC, it must be direct). So if you want to create a mesh of connections between a group of VPCs, each individual VPC-to-VPC connection must be configured independently. In this use case, a *transit gateway* might be more convenient.
