= Resources

Resources are launched into subnets. When you launch a resource, you will need to specify the subnet you want it to be launched into.

The AWS networking diagram above shows an EC2 instance launched in the public subnet. To do this, go to *EC2* > *Launch instance*.

Choose a system image, instance type, and create a public-private key pair if you do not already have one you can reuse.

Under *Network settings*, choose your VPC, and then choose the subnet you want to launch the instance into. For public instance, you want to choose the option to enable *auto-assign public IP*. Configure firewall settings by creating or reusing a security group. For most public resources, you will at least want an "ssh" security group rule from "anywhere".

[NOTE]
======
A *security group* is a virtual firewall that controls the traffic to and from your instances. It is a set of rules that filter traffic based on IP protocol, port, and source/destination IP address.

Click *Launch instance*. You now have an EC2 instance running in your public subnet.
