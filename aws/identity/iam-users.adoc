= IAM users

It is RECOMMENDED that you do not use the root user for everyday tasks, and that you do not share the root user credentials with others.

Instead, use the *Identity and Access Management (IAM)* service to create *users*, *groups*, *roles*, and *policies*.

IAM is a global service. It is not scoped to any particular AWS region.

The normal workflow is:

1. Add a user.
2. Add the user to a group.
3. Add a policy to the group (which will be inherited by all users in the group).

*Policies* define what resources a user can access, in terms of resources and services in AWS. IAM principals can then create those resources across AWS regions.

Policies MAY be attached directly to users, but it is best practice to attach them to groups instead. This makes it much easier to manage permissions across multiple users. This is especially important for large organizations with lots of users.
