= AWS CLI

To use the AWS CLI, you need to authenticate with a user that has *access keys*.

Via the Identity and Access Management (IAM) web console, go to *Security credentials* for your user, then *Access keys* > *Create access key*.

Once you've generated an access key, from your terminal run:

[source,sh]
----
aws configure
----

At the prompts:

* AWS Access Key ID: Paste your access key id
* AWS Secret Access Key: Paste your access key's secret
* Default region name: eg., `eu-west-2` for London
* Default output format: eg., `json`

To verify:

[source,sh]
----
cd ~/.aws
cat credentials
----

The output should reveal a default profile with your access keys:

[source,txt]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = ...
----

Now, anything that the IAM user can do in the AWS Management Console, you can do from the CLI.
