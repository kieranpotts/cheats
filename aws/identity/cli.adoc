= CLI

To use the *AWS CLI*, you need to authenticate with a user that has *access keys*.

You can create access keys via the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. In the IAM web console, go to *Security credentials* for your user, then *Access keys* > *Create access key*. Follow the steps to generate an access key.

Then the the following from your terminal:

[source,sh]
----
aws configure
----

At the prompts:

* *AWS Access Key ID*: Paste your access key id
* *AWS Secret Access Key*: Paste your access key's secret
* *Default region name*: eg., `eu-west-2` for London
* *Default output format*: eg., `json`

To verify:

[source,sh]
----
cd ~/.aws
cat credentials
----

The output should reveal a default profile with your access keys:

[source,txt]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = ...
----

Now, anything that the IAM user can do in the AWS Management Console, you can do from the CLI.
