= Shared responsibility model

In using AWS infrastructure, responsibility for security is shared between AWS and the customer. This is known as the "shared responsibility model".

AWS is responsible for the security _of_ the cloud: compute, storage, databases, networking, and the rest of the global infrastructure.

Customers are responsible for security _in_ the cloud: application security, data encryption (at rest and in transit), access management, OS patches, network and firewall configuration, and so on.
