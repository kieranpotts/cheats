= Subnets

Within availability zones we create *subnets*. A subnet is an *IP space* and it may be public or private. Public subnets have public accessibility, while private subnets do not have any direct connectivity from the outside world.

We launch resources into our subnets. We can achieve high availability by launching resources into subnets across different availability zones.

See the networking section for more information on subnets.
