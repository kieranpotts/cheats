= VPC Flow Logs

This is about logging what happens in an account at the network level. Flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC.

Flow logs can be created at the following levels:

* VPC
* Subnet
* Network interface (which is attached to EC2 instances)

Flow log data is stored in CloudWatch Logs.
