= Athena

*AWS Athena* is a serverless service to run SQL queries against data stored in places like:

- S3
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- DynamoDB
- DocumentDB
- Redis
- Redshift
- CloudWatch Logs
- CloudWatch Metrics
- Apache HBase
- _Etc._

You will need a Lambda function to connect Athena to your source (if not S3). You then map the data from the source into tables in Athena, and from their it can be queried.

Athena can query data in CSV, TSV, JSON, Parquet, and ORC formats.

To optimize Athena for performance you can:

* Partition your data.
* Use compression (Parquet or ORC are recommended).
* Optimize file sizes.
* Optimize columnar data store generation.
* Optimize ORDER BY and GROUP BY.
* Use approximate functions.
* Only include the columns you need.
