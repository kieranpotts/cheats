= Cost allocation tags

Cost allocation tags are a way of adding metadata to our resources and then using that metadata for billing purposes, so we can attribute costs to certain resources.

Normal tags are "activated" to become "cost allocation tags". There are both user-defined and AWS-defined cost allocation tags.
