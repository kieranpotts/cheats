= Consolidated billing

This is a feature of AWS Organizations. You get *one bill for multiple accounts*. This means you can easily track charges across multiple account, and download the combined cost and usage data.

You can also combine the usage across all accounts in the organization, so benefiting from volume pricing discounts and Reserved Instance discounts.

There are no extra fees for consolidated billing.
