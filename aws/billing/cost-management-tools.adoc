= Cost management tools

== Budgets and billing alerts

It is RECOMMENDED to setup billing alarms, so you don't spend more than you have budgeted for on AWS resources.

Go to *Billing and Cost Management* > *Preferences and settings* > *Billing preferences*. Under the *Alert preferences* panel, enable the options for Free Tier and CloudWatch alerts.

Next, under *Budgets and Planning*, click *Budgets*, and then *Create a budget*. Choose to *Use a template* and from their set your budget â€” eg. $5 per month.

Now that CloudWatch alerts are enabled for billing, you need to create some alarms. Go to *Cloudwatch* > *Create alarms*. You must be in the region US East (N. Virginia) (`us-east-1`) to create billing alarms because billing metrics are stored in this region. You can then choose *Billing* as your alarm metric. Set the threshold.

== Consolidated billing

This is a feature of AWS Organizations. You get *one bill for multiple accounts*. This means you can easily track charges across multiple accounts, and download the combined cost and usage data.

You can also combine the usage across all accounts in the organization, so benefiting from volume pricing discounts and Reserved Instance discounts.

There are no extra fees for consolidated billing.

== AWS Cost Explorer

This is a free tool that allows you to view itemized breakdowns of your spending in a graphical format.

You can view cost daa for the past 13 months, and forecast what you are likely to spend over the next three months.

Cost Explorer can be used to discover patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time, and to identify cost problem areas.

Cost Explorer can help you to identify service usage statistics, such as:

* Which services you use the most.
* Which AZs have the most traffic.
* Which linked accounts are used the most.

== AWS Cost & Usage Report

This service publishes billing reports to an S3 bucket.

Reports break down costs by the hour, day, month, product, product resource, and tags.

You can have updated reports up to three times a day.

You can create, retrieve, and delete your reports using the AWS CUR API.

== Cost Allocation Tags

Cost Allocation Tags are a way of adding metadata to our resources and then using that metadata for billing purposes, so we can attribute costs to certain resources.

Normal tags are "activated" to become Cost Allocation Tags. There are both user-defined and AWS-defined Cost Allocation Tags.

== AWS Price List API

This allows you to query the prices of AWS services. There are two components to this:

* *Price List Service API* (aka the Query API), which you query with JSON.
* *Price List API* (aka the Bulk API), which you download in bulk and query with HTML.

Alerts can be sent via SNS when prices change.

== AWS Calculator

The AWS Calculator is served from https://calculator.aws.

Use it to to estimate the cost of the components that you want to build into your AWS cloud infrastructure.
