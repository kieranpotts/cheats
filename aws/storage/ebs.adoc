= Elastic Block Store (EBS)

*Elastic Block Store (EBS)* is a high-performance block storage services using by EC2 instances. EBS volumes are used as the primary storage for EC2 instances, and can be used to store data, applications, and operating systems.

EBS supports multiple volume types, including SSD and HDD. SSD is a good choice for transactional workloads, while HDD is good for throughput-intensive workloads.

You can create point-in-time backups of your EBS volumes, called *snapshots*.
