= Access keys

To access the web console, users will authenticate using their username and password.

For programmatic access via the HTTP API or CLI, users will need *access keys*. There are two parts:

* *Access key ID*
* *Secret access key*

In addition, the AWS *Security Token Service (STS)* can be sued to generate short-ter access credentials.
