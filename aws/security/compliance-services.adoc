= Compliance services

*AWS Config* is a service you can use for configuration compliance auditing.

*AWS Artifact* is another compliance service. It provides on-demand access to AWS' security and compliance reports â€” so you can see the security and compliance documents that relate to the AWS platform itself.

The reports made available include *Service Organization Control (SOC)* reports, and *Payment Card Industry (PCI)* reports. It also provides certifications from various accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals, which validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls.

There are also some select agreements that are made available, such as the *Business Associate Addendum (BAA)* and the *Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)*.

AWS Artifacts has some very useful information if you are building a solution that has high security compliance requirements, like a PCI-compliant solution.
