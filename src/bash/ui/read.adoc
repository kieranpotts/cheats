= Bash: Reading user input

You can prompt for user input and capture that in a variable, using `read`:

[source,bash]
----
echo Please, enter your name
read user_name

echo "Hi ${user_name}!"
----

You can get multiple values with `read`, too:

[source,bash]
----
echo Please, enter your first and last name.
read first_name last_name

echo "Hi! ${first_name} ${last_name}!"
----

[IMPORTANT]
======
Always validate user input.
