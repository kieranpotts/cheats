= Bash: User selections (`select`)

Bash offers the `select` construct, which is designed specifically for user-driven, interactive scripts. It provides a simple text-based menu from which the user chooses an option from a list of available options.

It tends to be used in conjunction with a nested `case` statement (but you could equally use `if` conditionals), to handle the user's input choice.

[source,bash]
----
select option in "Option 1" "Option 2" "Quit"; do
  case $option in
    "Option 1") echo "You chose Option 1" ;;
    "Quit") break ;;
    *) echo "Invalid option" ;;
  esac
done
