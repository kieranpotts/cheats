= Bash: Basic piping

Pipes let you use the output of one program as the input of another.

In the following example the following happens: first, the command `ls -l` is executed, and its output, instead of being printed, is piped to the `sed` program.

[source,bash]
----
ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"
----
