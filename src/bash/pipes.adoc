= Bash: Pipes

Pipes let you use the output of one program as the input of another.

In the following example the following happens: first, the command `ls -l` is executed, and its output, instead of being printed, is piped to the `sed` program.

[source,bash]
----
ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"
----

Pipelines that do not neatly fit on one line MAY be split across multiple lines. Double indentation SHOULD be used for follow-on lines.(This rule also applies to logical compounds using `||` and `&&`.)

[source,bash]
----
command1 | command2

command1 \
    | command2 \
    | command3 \
    | command4
----
