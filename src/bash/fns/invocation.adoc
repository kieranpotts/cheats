= Bash: Function invocation

In Bash, doing any of the following operations involves the exact same syntax:

* Calling a function.
* Running a program.
* Running a built-in command.

The syntax is:

----
<function_name> <arg1> <arg2> ...
----

Example:

[source,bash]
----
function print_me {
  echo $1
}

print_me "Hello, World!"
----

A variable number of arguments can be passed to any function (or program or built-in command). It is up to the function or program to verify that any required arguments have been provided.
