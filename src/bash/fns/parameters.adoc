= Bash: Function parameters

A variable number of arguments can be passed to any function (or program or built-in command). It is up to the function or program to verify that any required arguments have been provided.

In Bash functions, like Bash scripts, parameters are indexed, not named. `$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second argument, and so on. In the following example, the function `print_me` just prints the first argument it receives.

[source,bash]
----
function print_me {
  echo $1
}

print_me "Hello, World!"
----
