= Bash: Declaring functions

As in other scripting and programming languages, in Bash you use functions to group pieces of code in a logical way, and to implement recursion.

You declare a function with the following syntax:

----
function [function_name] {
  # function body
}
----

This is an _explicit_ function declaration. _Implicit_ function declarations are possible with the following syntax:

----
[function_name] {
  # function body
}
----

.Examples
[source,bash]
----
# Explicit declaration.
function some_function () {
  return 0
}

# Implicit declaration.
some_function () {
  return 0
}
----

The explicit alternative gives more readability, but the implicit one is the POSIX standard so it is more portable.

The function body is placed inside the curly braces.

Functions don't need to be declared in any specific order.
