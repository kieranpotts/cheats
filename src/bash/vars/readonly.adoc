= Bash: Read-only variables (constants)

Variables may be turned into constants, which means their value cannot be changed once assigned. This is done by enabling the `readonly` _attribute_ of a variable.

[source,bash]
----
readonly str="Hello, World!"
echo "${str}"
----

You can also declare a variable, assign a value to it, and then subsequently mark it as `readonly`.
