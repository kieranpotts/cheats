= Bash: Types

Unix shells don't have formal data types, like high-level programming languages. Instead, every variable value is treated as a string by default.

But there are behaviors that interpret values into other types. For examples, variables are treated as integers when used in arithmetic contexts.

Furthermore, community conventions have emerged for simulating other types; for example, the string values `"true"` and `"false"` are commonly used to represent boolean values.
