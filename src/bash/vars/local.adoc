= Bash: Local variables

Bash supports `local` variables, which are variables scoped to the function they are declared in.

[source,bash]
----
hello="hello"

function hello {
  # This local variable is distinct from the global one with the same name.
  local hello="world"
  echo "${hello}" # → "world"
}

echo "${hello}" # → "hello" (unchanged)
----

Local variables may be declared, then subsequently assigned. This is a common pattern.

[source,bash]
----
local hello
hello="world"
----
