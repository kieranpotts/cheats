= Bash: Built-in variables

Bash defines a number of "special variables" that are built-in to the shell, and the values are automatically assigned by the shell.

Built-in variables provide useful information about the shell's state and the execution environment.

The following are built-in variables:

[source,bash]
----
$0              # Name of shell or shell script.
$1, $2, $3, ... # Positional parameters (from command-line input arguments).
$#              # Number of positional parameters.
$?              # Most recent foreground pipeline exit status.
$-              # Current options set for the shell.
$$              # PID of the current shell (not sub-shell).
$!              # The PID of the most recent background command.
$_              # Last argument of the previously executed command,
                #   or the path of the bash script.
----

These special variables MAY also be written using the bracketed syntax, eg. `${0}`, but they tend not to be.
