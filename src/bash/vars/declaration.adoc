= Bash: Declaring variables

You don't need to declare variables. You just assign a value to a reference, and that is enough to create the variable.

[source,bash]
----
str="Hello, World!"
echo "${str}"
----

IMPORTANT: Unlike most programming languages, there MUST NOT be spaces around the assignment operator (`=`).

You MAY declare a value and then subsequently assign a value to it. This pattern is commonly used for `local` variables.

[source,bash]
----
local hello
hello="world"
----
