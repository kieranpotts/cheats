= Bash: `until` loops

The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, except it is inverted: the loop executes for as long as the condition is `false`.

[source,bash]
----
until [ condition ]; do
  # Commands to execute until condition is true.
done
----

`until` is useful for doing things like running commands until a file exists, or until a service starts, or otherwise polling something until success.
