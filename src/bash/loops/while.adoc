= Bash: `while` loops

A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.

[source,bash]
----
while [ condition ]; do
  # Commands to execute while condition is true.
done
----

`while` loops are useful when you need to wait for a process to finish, to monitor system state, or to continue to read input until a precondition changes.
