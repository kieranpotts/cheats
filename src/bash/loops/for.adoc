= Bash: `for` loops

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a list of items.

[source,bash]
----
for item in list; do
  # Commands to execute for each item.
done
----

C-style `for` syntax is also supported:

[source,bash]
----
for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do
  # Commands here will be executed exactly 10 times.
done
----

`for` loops are great for looping through dynamically-generated lists of things, like files found on the local filesystem, or for repeating a task a fixed number of times.
