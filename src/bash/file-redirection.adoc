= File redirection

Instead of printing the output of commands to the console, you can instead write the output to files. This is a common pattern in Bash scripting â€“ particularly for logging.

The two operators for file redirection are:

* `>`: Redirect output to a file, overwriting the file if it already exists.
* `>>`: Append output to a file.

You might use a combination of both: `>` to initially clear or create the log file, then `>>` for subsequent writes.

[source,bash]
----
# Write to file (overwrites existing content).
echo -e "\n" > "$log_file"

# Append output to file.
echo "==== Analyzing log files in $log_dir directory" >> "$log_file"
