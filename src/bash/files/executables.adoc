= Bash: Executables

A Bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that can be executed by the Bash shell. The file must have executable permissions set, which can be done with the command:

----
chmod +x <script-file>
----

To execute the file, with the file in the current working directory, prefix the file name with `./`:

----
./<script-file>
----

If the file is not in the current working directory, you can provide the absolute or relative path to the file:

----
/path/to/<script-file>
----

To pass arguments to the script, append them after the script name:

----
./<script-file> <arg1> <arg2>
----

The `.sh` file extension is not required. It is RECOMMENDED to omit the extension on files that are intended to be used as executable commands like this, but to keep the `.sh` extension for Bash libraries â€“ ie. Bash files that are intended to be sourced from other scripts, but not executed directly.
