= Bash conditionals: `if`

The `if` statement is used for control flow. It works by executing commands based on the evaluation of conditional expressions.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,bash]
----
if [ conditional_expression1 ] ; then
  operation1
elif [ conditional_expression2 ] ; then
  operation2
else
  operation3
fi
----

Or written like this:

[source,bash]
----
if [ conditional_expression1 ]
then
  operation1
elif [ conditional expression2 ]
then
  operation2
else
  operation3
fi
----

.Example
[source,bash]
----
count=99

if [ $count -eq 100 ] ; then
  echo "Count is 100"
elif [ $count -gt 100 ] ; then
  echo "Count is greater than 100"
else
  echo "Count is less than 100"
fi
----

The `elif` and `else` blocks are optional. There may be zero, one, or multiple `elif` blocks, but there can be only one `if` block and exactly zero or one `else` blocks.

Conditional constructs are terminated by `fi`, meaning "finish" or "if" backwards â€“ however you like to think of it!

Multiple statements may be included within each conditional block. As a matter of style, inner statements SHOULD be indented from their containing conditional construct.

== Nesting

Bash supports nested conditional statements.

[source,bash]
----
if [ conditional_expression1 ]; then
  operation1
  operation2
else
  if [ conditional_expression2 ]; then
    operation3
  fi
fi
----

However, nesting reduces readability and understandability. It increases the risk of errors, and it makes debugging harder. Work to refactor complex conditional logic.
