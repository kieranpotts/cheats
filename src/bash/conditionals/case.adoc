= Bash conditionals: `case`

// TODO

== Select options

Case conditionals are perhaps most useful when combined with the `select` built-in. This is designed specifically for user-driven, interactive scripts. It provides a simple text-based menu from which the user chooses an option from a list of available options.

[source,bash]
----
select option in "Option 1" "Option 2" "Quit"; do
  case $option in
    "Option 1") echo "You chose Option 1" ;;
    "Quit") break ;;
    *) echo "Invalid option" ;;
  esac
done
