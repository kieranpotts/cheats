= Bash: Shorthand conditional syntax

The `&&` and `||` operators may be used to form shorthand conditional statements, executing commands based on the results of preceding commands.

[source,bash]
----
A && B  # Run B if and only if A succeeded
A || B  # Run B if and only if A failed
----

Using `&&` is the equivalent of running an `if` check on the result of the left-side command. This syntax can also help to flatten nested conditionals.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pyrenamer

# Equivalent to:
if sudo apt-get update ; then
  sudo apt-get install pyrenamer
fi
----

This syntax can be combined with `[ … ]` and Bash-specific `[[ … ]]` test syntax:

[source,bash]
----
[ -z "${var}" ] && echo "var is empty"
[ -z "${var}" ] || echo "var is not empty"
[ -z "${var}" ] && echo "var is empty" || echo "var is not empty"

[[ ! -z "${var}" ]] && echo "var is not empty"
[[ ! -z "${var}" ]] echo "var is empty"
[[ ! -z "${var}" ]] && echo "var is not empty" || echo "var is empty"
