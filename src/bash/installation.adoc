= Bash: Installation

Bash is bundled with most mainstream Linux distributions. You can check which version you have by typing:

----
bash --version
----

Bash is bundled with macOS, but since Catalina (10.15) it is not the default shell (which was changed to Zsh). To switch to the Bash shell on macOS, type:

----
bash
----

To make Bash the default shell again:

----
chsh -s /bin/bash
----

On Windows, it is recommended to install Windows Subsystem for Linux, as the Bash implementation in Ubuntu is more complete than emulators like Git Bash.

----
wsl --install
----
