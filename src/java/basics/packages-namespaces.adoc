= Java: Packages and namespaces

Almost all classes (and other constructs) within an application or library SHOULD be part of a package. Packages help organize classes and avoid naming conflicts.

[source,java]

package tools;

When creating libraries for consumption in other projects, you need to create a unique "namespace" for all your classes, so they are unique not only in the current project but in *all* Java projects the world over.

A convention is to flip your domain name, so "google.com" becomes "com.google".

[source,java]
----
package com.google.java;
