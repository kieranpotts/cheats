= JShell

JShell was introduced in Java 9. It is a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool for Java, allowing you to quickly test snippets of Java code without needing to run a full compilation and execution cycle.

To launch JShell, run this command in your terminal:

[source,sh]
----
jshell
----

This will start the JShell interactive environment, where you can type Java code and see the results immediately.

----
jshell> System.out.println("Hello, JShell!");
Hello, JShell!
----

To exit the JShell environment, type `/exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.
