= Java: Compilation and execution

To run a Java program, there are two steps:

* Compile the Java source code into bytecode using the `javac` command.
* Execute the compiled bytecode using the `java` command.

[source,sh]
----
# Produces an artifact named <filename>.class
javac <filename>.java

# Runs <filename>.class in the JVM.
java <filename>
----

The above commands will typically be run on an application's root class file, which contains the `main` method that accepts an array of `String` input arguments from the command line.

Alternatively, you can run the `java` program directly on a `*.java` file. This will compile and run the file in one step. This is useful for quick tests or small scripts. It does not produce a built artifact and it works only when there is a single file to compile and execute. This is intended only for use in development.
