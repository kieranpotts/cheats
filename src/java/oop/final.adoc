= Java: Final

The `final` keyword can be used on classes, methods, and class variables (fields).

You should always use the `final` keyword for values that are intended to be constants.

[source,java]
----
public class FinalInJava {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    /* Declare a final variable and assign a value. */
    final int x = 10;

    /* Compile error: cannot assign a value to final variable x */
    x = 20;

    /* Declare a final variable, but defer assigning its value.
    You will be allowed to set the variable's value once only. */
    final int y;
    y = 20;

    /* Compile error: cannot assign a value to final variable y */
    y = 30;
  }
}
----

The `final` keyword can also be used to prevent class inheritance.

[source,java]
----
final class Calculator {
  public int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

/* Compile error - Calculator cannot be extended because it is final. */
class AdvancedCalculator extends Calculator {
   //  â€¦
}
----

Alternatively, a class can be kept open for extension but the `final` keyword can be used to prevent individual methods from being overridden via subclasses. This gives a bit more flexibility. Subclasses can still override non-final methods and add new methods.

[source,java]
----
class Calculator {
  public final int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
