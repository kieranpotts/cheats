= Java: Upcasting and downcasting

*Upcasting* is where we cast an object to a parent class. In the example below, we create an instance of `B` but we cast it to type `A`, which is a super class of `B`.

[source,java]
----
class A {
  public void show1() {
    System.out.println("A");
  }
}

class B extends A {
  public void show2() {
    System.out.println("B");
  }
}

A a = (A) new B();
a.show1(); // "A"
----

Or you can just do this - you don't actually need to explicitly cast it:

[source,java]
----
A a = new B();
a.show1(); // "A"
----

*Downcasting* is where we cast an object to a child class. We do this when we want to access the method or fields of the child class.

[source,java]
----
a.show2(); // Error: The method show2() is undefined for the type A

B b = (B) a;
b.show2(); // "B"
----
