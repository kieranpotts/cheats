= Java: Anonymous objects

In Java, *anonymous objects* are instances of classes that are created without assigning them to a variable. They are often used when you need to pass an object as an argument to a method, or when you want to invoke a method on an object, without needing to keep a reference to it.

class A {
  public void show() {
    System.out.println("Hello");
