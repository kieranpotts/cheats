= Java: Primitive data types

Java's eight primitive data types are:

* `byte`
* `short`
* `int`
* `long`
* `float`
* `double`
* `char`
* `boolean`

These are also known as *literals*, as they represent fixed (constant) values that are assigned to variables in the code. Using literals simplifies the code and make it more readable. Literals are constants and cannot be changed during program execution once defined.

[source,java]
----
/* byte, 1 byte, stores whole numbers -128 to 127. */
byte by = 127;

/* short, 2 bytes, stores whole numbers -32768 to 32767. */
short sh = 558;

/* int, 4 bytes, stores whole numbers -2147483648 to 2147483647. */
int nm = 9;

/* long, 8 bytes, stores whole numbers -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. */
long l = 5854l;

/* float, 4 bytes, stores fractional numbers of 6 to 7 decimal digits. */
float num4 = 5.6f;

/* double, 8 bytes, stores fractional numbers of 15 decimal digits. */
double num3 = 5.6;

/* char, 2 bytes, stores a single character/letter or ASCII/Unicode value. */
char c = 'k';

/* boolean, 1 bit, stores true or false values. */
boolean b = true;
----

== Integer literals

Integer literals represent whole numbers, and can be expressed in four different number systems:

* decimal (base 10)
* octal (base 8)
* hexadecimal (base 16)
* binary (base 2)

Integers are Base 10 by default. You can specify base 8 or 16 by adding `0` or `0x` prefix respectively. You can specify base 2 (ie. a binary literal, a number represented only by 0s and 1s) by adding the `0b` or `0B` prefix.

[source,java]
----
/* Decimal (base 10) */
int decimal = 101; // 101

/* Octal (base 8 - uses digits 0-7 and prefixed with 0) */
int octal = 0146; // = 102 in decimal

/* Hexadecimal (base 16 - uses digits 0-9 and letter A-F, prefixed 0x or 0X) */
int hex = 0x1F; // = 31 in decimal

/* Binary (base 2 - uses digits 0 and 1, prefixed 0b or 0B */
int base2 = 0b101; // = 5 in decimal
----

For readability, you can use the underscore character `_` to separate groups of digits in numeric literals.

[source,java]
----
int cleanNumber = 1_000_000_000;
----

There are some restrictions on the use of underscores:

* Cannot start or end with a number with an underscore.
* Cannot place an underscore adjacent to a decimal point in a floating-point literal.
* Cannot place an underscore adjacent to F or L suffixes.

For very big numbers – bigger than the range of long – you can use the epsilon notation (e):

[source,java]
----
double bigNumber = 12e10;
----

The `++` and `--` operators increment and decrement by 1 respectively. This can be used on chars as well as ints.

[source,java]
----
char ch = 'c';
ch++;
System.out.println(ch); // 'd'
----

== Floating-point literals

Floating-point literals represent numbers with fractional parts and can be of type `float` or `double`. By default, floating-point literals are of type `double`. To specify a `float`, you need to append an `f` or `F` suffix. Optionally, doubles may be suffixed with `d` or `D`.

[source,java]
----
double pi = 3.14159; // double by default
double piAlt = 3.14159d; // double with 'd' suffix
float price = 19.99f; // float
----

Exponential notation can also be used for floating-point literals, where `e` or `E` indicates the power of 10.

[source,java]
----
double scientific = 1.234e42;
----

Floating point literals are also known as *real literals*.

== Boolean literals

Boolean literals represent truth values and can be only `true` or `false`.

[source,java]
----
boolean isTrue = true;
boolean isFalse = false;
----

== Character literals

Character literals are single characters enclosed in single quotes. They can also represent special characters using escape sequences.

[source,java]
----
char letter = 'a';
char symbol = '$';
char unicodeChar = '\u000d'; // Unicode representation
----

== String literals

String literals are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.

[source,java]
----
String name = "John Doe";
String numberString = "12345"; // String representation of a number
String newLine = "\n";
----

== Null literal

There is a special literal called `null`, which represents the absence of a value. It can be assigned to any reference type, indicating that the variable does not point to any object.
