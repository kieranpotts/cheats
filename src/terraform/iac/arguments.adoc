The part before the `=` sign is the _argument name_ and the part after the `=` sign is the _argument value_. Many arguments accept arbitrary expressions, which allow the vale to be generated from other values programmatically.

Arguments are used to configure the behavior of a block. What values are allowed can vary depending on the block type.
