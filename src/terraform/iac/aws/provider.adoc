= AWS: Provider

For AWS, the provider name is "aws".

The "region" argument is required.

[source]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}
----

Access credentials are required. These MAY be hard-coded or injected from environment variables.

[source]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"

  access_key = "AKIA..."
  secret_key = "yvDpm..."
}
----

However, hard-coding credentials is NOT recommended. Instead, credentials SHOULD be set in profiles, which are configured in `~/.aws/credentials` (or the equivalent for other providers).

In the following example, the credentials are loaded from the "default" profile.

[source]
----
provider "aws" {
  profile = "default"
  region = "eu-west-2"
}
----

.~/.aws/credentials
[source]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = yvDpm...
----

Further configuration options for the AWS provider can be found in the official documentation:
