= Terraform CLI: Applying

Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes to your infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
======
It is RECOMMENDED to always run `terraform plan` before running `terraform apply`, to see what changes will be made. However, the `apply` operation will also ask you to confirm the changes before proceeding.
======

When applying, you can override any default values for variables – declared via `variables.tf` or `terraform.tfvars` – and used within the Terraform files, eg.:

----
$ terraform apply -var "instance_name="MyNewNameEC2"
----

If you have more than a few variables to set, then better to create a file called `terraform.tfvars` and set the variables there – that's the purpose of this file.
