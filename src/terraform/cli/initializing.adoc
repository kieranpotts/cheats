= Terraform CLI: Initializing

Whenever you create a new Terraform config, you need to run `terraform init` from the directory containing the config files.

This "initializes the back-end", which is to say it downloads and enabled the plugins (binary files) necessary to interact with your infrastructure provider.

This generates a lock file called `.terraform.lock.hcl`. It is RECOMMENDED to commit this to source control, which guarantees that everyone will install the exact same dependencies when they run `terraform init` at the same commit point.

[IMPORTANT]
======
It is RECOMMENDED to always run `terraform init` before running any additional `terraform` commands, after pulling changes from source control.
