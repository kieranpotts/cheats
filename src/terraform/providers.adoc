= Terraform: Providers

Providers are a logical abstraction of an upstream API that exposes certain resources, such as web services or databases. Providers are typically cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, or GCP, or they may be services such as Kubernetes.

Terraform providers are plugins that are available from the https://registry.terraform.io/[Terraform Registry].

Providers are configured in Terraform files in "provider blocks", eg.:

[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
  access_key = "AKIA..."
  secret_key = "yvDpm..."
}
----

Developers SHOULD NOT hard-code access credentials in Terraform files. See the examples for individual cloud providers for more information.

To configure providers, follow the relevant documentation in the Terraform registry. The documentation for the AWS provider is here: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs
