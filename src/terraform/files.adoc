= Terraform: Files

While you can organize your infrastructure-as-code however you like, common practice is to include the following files:


* `terraform.tf` — Contains a single `terraform` block that defines Terraform version constraints (`required_version`) and provider version requirements (`required_providers`).
* `backend.tf` — Back-end configuration for remote state storage.
* `providers.tf` — Cloud provider configuration (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
* `main.tf` — The project's main resources and data source blocks.
* `variables.tf` — Variable blocks, in alphabetical order.
* `locals.tf` — Local values.
* `outputs.tf` — Output definitions, in alphabetical order.
* `override.tf` or `*_override.tf` files — Override definitions.

Terraform will process all `.tf` files in a directory (excluding sub-directories) as a single configuration, regardless of how you split the code across files. But the above structure is a common convention that offers a good starting point for most projects.

The following files are also commonly included in the root directory of a Terraform project:

* `terraform.tfvars`: Variable values (optional file); MUST be excluded from source control if it contains sensitive information (an empty `terraform.tfvars.example` file MAY be committed for reference).
* `terraform.tfstate`: Terraform state file (auto-generated; MUST be excluded from public code repositories, MAY be committed to private code repositories with encryption-at-rest).
* `.terraform.lock.hcl`: Dependency lock file (auto-generated but SHOULD be committed to source control).
* `.terraform/`: Directory containing Terraform's working files (auto-generated; MUST be excluded from source control).
