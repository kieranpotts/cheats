= Terraform: Files

While you can organize your infrastructure-as-code however you like, common practice is to include the following files:

* `main.tf`: Primary configuration file.
* `variables.tf`: Variable declarations, or inputs for modules.
* `outputs.tf`: Output definitions.
* `providers.tf`: Provider configuration (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
* `versions.tf`: Terraform version constraints and provider version requirements.

Terraform will process all `.tf` files in a directory (excluding sub-directories) as a single configuration, regardless of how you split the code across files. But the above structure is a common convention that offers a good starting point for most projects.

The following files are also commonly included in the root directory of a Terraform project:

* `terraform.tfvars`: Variable values (optional).
* `terraform.tfstate`: Terraform state file (auto-generated but committed to source control).
* `.terraform.lock.hcl`: Dependency lock file (auto-generated but committed to source control).
* `.terraform/`: Directory containing Terraform's working files (auto-generated, excluded from source control).
