= Terraform Cloud

https://app.terraform.io/[Terraform Cloud] is another Terraform implementation â€“ a SaaS application and an alternative to using the CLI.

Terraform Cloud may be a good choice for large teams of cloud engineers.

Features of Terraform Cloud include:

* Remote execution of Terraform commands, so you don't need to install Terraform on your local machine.
* Integration with version control systems like GitHub and GitLab (so you can do things like execute deployments from pull requests, say).
* Integration with Slack, Email, and Webhooks for notifications of deployments and their changes.
* Remote state can be stored in Terraform Cloud itself (though you may still use other back-ends like S3 if you prefer).
* Terraform Cloud can also be used as a registry for your Terraform modules (as an alternative to use Git repositories).
* Authorization and access controls: different levels of access for different users.
* Cost estimation: estimate the cost of the infrastructure before applying it.

Paid features include:

* Sentinel policies: rules around who can deploy what.

Cost estimation can be used in conjunction with sentinel policies to prevent deploying resources that would exceed a configured cost threshold.
