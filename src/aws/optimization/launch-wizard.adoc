= AWS Launch Wizard

This is a relatively new service that offers a guided way of sizing, configuring, and deploying AWS resources for third-party applications.

It focuses on the deployment of enterprise applications like:

* MS SQL Server
* SAP
* Remote Desktop Gateway
* Amazon EKS
* Microsoft IIS
* Exchange Server
* Microsoft Active Directory

The Launch Wizard will automatically identify and deploy the most cost-effective and optimal resources for your application, based on your input and requirements.

Why use it â€” rather than do everything yourself?

* *Simplified deployments*: Offers a straightforward solution to deploy complex applications, removing the traditional complexities involved if you tried to do it all yourself.

* *Resource optimization*: Ensures that you get the best utilization of AWS resources tailored to your application needs.

* *Quick start*: It facilitates a quick start to application deployment, helping businesses to get their applications up and running in a shorter timeframe.

AWS Launch Wizard is a free service. You pay only for the resources provisioned through the service, such as EC2, EBS, and VPC resources.
