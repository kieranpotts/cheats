= AWS Route53

Route53 is AWS's DNS service. Features include:

* *Domain name registration*.

* *Public hosted zones*. These are created automatically when you register a public domain via Route53. This is where your public DNS records are hosted, and where other DNS servers look up your domain name's DNS records.

* *Private hosted zones*. You can also create private hosted zones, which get associated with a VPC so you can maintain DNS records for internal virtual servers.

* *Health checks*. This service checks that EC2 instances and load balancers, and other IP endpoints, are active. The service can be configured to automatically reroute traffic to a failover region if resources in your primary region become unavailable. This is known as the *active/passive failover* technique. There are a variety of routing options that are available, and are set via *routing policies* â€” see below.

* *Traffic Flow*: This service allows a bit more logic in terms of how you direct traffic to different resources.

== Route53 routing policies

You can apply logic to how Route53 responds to DNS queries.

|===
|Routing policy | Description

|Simple
|Simply provides the IP address associated with the name.

|Failover
|If the primary resource is down (based on health checks), route to secondary destination.

|Geolocation
|Route to the closest region based on the client's location.

|Geoproximity
|Routes to the closest region within a geographic area.

|Latency
|Directs requests based on the lowest-latency route to resources.

|Multi-value answer
|Returns several IP addresses, functioning as a basic load balancer.

|Weighted
|Use the relative weights assigned to resources, eg. send 80% of traffic to one resource, and 20% to another.

|IP-based
|Route based on the originating IP address of the request.
