= AWS Data Exchange

*AWS Data Exchange* is used to subscribe to data feeds from third-party data providers/publishers â€” services like "apptopia" (for performance data on mobile apps) and "SimilarWeb" (for global website rankings).

Subscribers fetch the data feeds from the Data Exchange API, which provides a uniform abstraction of thousands of third-party APIs. For example, you might use a Lambda function to fetch the feeds and port the data to your own stores.

There are currently over 3,500 data sets from more than 300 publishers. You, too, can use Data Exchange to publish your own data feeds, for others to subscribe to.

There are a few related products:

* *Data Exchange for S3*: Subscribers can find, subscribe to, and use third-party files directly from publishers' S3 buckets.

* *Data Exchange for Lake Formation*: Get access to live, ready-to-use structured tables through Lake Formation.

* *Data APIs*: Use IAM credentials and SDKs to call data APIs from all of the data providers in Data Exchange.

* *Data Files*: Automatically export new or updated data to your S3 buckets.

* *Data Tables*: Find and subscribe to third-party data in Data Exchange, and directly query that data in minutes via Redshift.
