= AWS DynamoDB

*DynamoDB* is a fully-managed, serverless, NoSQL database services with *in-memory performance*, *low latency* (in milliseconds), *high I/O*, and both dynamic *auto-scaling* or manual *push-button scaling* with no downtime. It can be very cost effective for many storage use cases.

DynamoDB can be used as both a *key-value store* and as a *document database*. The core components are:

* *Tables*
* *Items* (analogous to rows in relational DBs)
* *Attributes* (each item has one or more attributes)

Data is stored in *partitions* that are replicated across multiple availability zones in a region.
As you data grows, it automatically gets stored across more partitions â€” so maintaining durability and redundancy at scale. Scaling happens without downtime.

When you adjust the performance characteristics of your database, AWS automatically adjusts how data is stored to optimize read and write performance as you require.

*DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)* is an optional in-memory cache that sits in front of DynamoDB to achieve even lower latency.

.Key features
****

== Pricing

Pricing can be based on either provisioned throughput or on-demand capacity.

The first option means you choose a *provisioned capacity* and you pay for the volume of reads and writes that you have allocated. This is a good option when you understand the performance requirements ad usage patterns of your application.

Otherwise, choose *on-demand capacity*. You will pay for the _actual_ read and write operations performed, without needing to worry about capacity planning.

In addition, you pay for the *storage costs* of your data. Additional costs also apply for use of the Global Tables service, DynamoDB Streams, backups and restore, and other add-on features.
