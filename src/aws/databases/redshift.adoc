= AWS Redshift

*Amazon Redshift* is a fully-managed *data warehouse* solution for Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) use cases on very large volumes of aggregated data, stored in relational formats.

Redshift runs on EC2 instance, so you scale up by changing the instance type in the normal way.

Redshift automatically keeps three copies of your data, for durability. It can also do continuous, incremental backups.

Typically, data is loaded into a warehouse from production databases and other sources. Data can then be analyzed using *business intelligence (BI)* tools such as *QuickSight*, or even good-old SQL.
