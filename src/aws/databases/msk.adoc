= AWS Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK)

*Amazon MSK* is a fully-managed service that enables you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data. This service is used for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time.

This is an alternative to Kinesis, which is proprietary to Amazon.

MSK provides the control-plane operations, such as those for creating, updating, and deleting clusters. Kafka itself provides the data-plane operations â€” those for producing and consuming data.

Components of MSK include:

* *Topics*: The Kafka name for data streams.

* *Producers*: Kafka clients that publish data to topics.

* *Consumers*: Kafka client that read data from topics

* *Kafka clusters*: At the core of MSK is a set of Kafka brokers, coordinated by Zookeeper nodes.

* *Broker nodes*: These are Kafka servers that store data and serve clients. Clusters typically contain multiple brokers to ensure data reliability and availability.

* *Zookeeper nodes*: Manage and coordinate the Kafka brokers. MSK automatically sets up a highly available *Zookeeper ensemble* (ie. Zookeeper nodes) for every Kafka cluster.
