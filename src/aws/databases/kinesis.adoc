= Kinesis

*Amazon Kinesis* is actually made up of lots of different services that are all related to *streaming data* use cases. Example use cases include:

* Purchases from online stores.
* Stock prices.
* Game data.
* Social network data.
* Geospatial data.
* IoT sensor data.

The commonality here is fairly large but consistent streams of small individual units of data. Kinesis is optimized to handle data streams like these.

*Kinesis Data Streams* is a service that allows data producers to store data in shards for up to 7 days. Consumers then process the data and save it to another service.

*Kinesis Data Firehose* serves data directly to another service, eg. S3, Splunk, Redshift, or Elasticsearch. It is completely automated, elastically scalable, and there are no shards â€” just a stream of data.

*Kinesis Data Analytics* provides real-time SQL processing on streaming data.

There is also a *video analytics* service in the Kinesis family.
