= Elastic MapReduce (EMR)

Hadoop is a framework for *big data* (ie. analytics on very large quantities of data). EMR is a managed implementation of Hadoop.

Use cases include processing data for analytics and business intelligence, and also for transforming and moving very large amounts of data (for example in a data migration scenario).

A MapReduce system performs *extract, transform, and load (ETL)* functions, ie. extracting data from one system and transforming it into some other database format and schema.

Data storage options include:

* S3 / S3 Glacier
* Redshift
* DynamoDB
* RDS
* HDFS (also from Hadoop)
