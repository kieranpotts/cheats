= AWS: Custom databases

When you need full control over a database and its runtime environment, or when you need to use a database engine that is not supported by any of AWS's services, then you have the option of installing any database management system you like into an EC2 instance.

The trade-off is you will be responsible for administration of the database management system â€” not AWS.
