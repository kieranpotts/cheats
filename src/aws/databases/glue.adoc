= Glue

*AWS Glue* is a fully-managed *extract, transform, and load (ETL)* service. It is used to prepare data for analytics. Commonly, it is used to build tables in Athena.

AWS Glue runs the ETL jobs on a fully-managed, scale-out Apache Spark environment. (You could also use Apache Hive for this purpose.)

AWS Glue discovers data and stores the associated metadata (eg. table definition and schema) in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can use a *crawler* to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with data tables. A crawler can crawl multiple data stores in a single run. Upon completion, the crawler create or updates one or more tables in your Data Catalog.

It works with data lakes (eg. data in S3), data warehouses (including Redshift), and data stores (including RDS and other EC2-hosted databases).
