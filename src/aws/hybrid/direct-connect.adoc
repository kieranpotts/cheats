= AWS Direct Connect

*AWS Direct Connect* enables *private connections* from on-premises data centers to AWS. This offers a dedicated physical connection from your data center into the AWS backbone.

Thus, *hybrid clouds* are established without relying on the public internet for connectivity.

AWS Direct Connect provides high bandwidth and low latency, with reliable performance.

AWS Direct Connect can be used to establish connections between your on-premises data center and your AWS VPCs, and also to AWS services that are outside of your VPCs and in AWS's public address space, such as S3 and CloudWatch Logs.
