= AWS Outposts

If you have a corporate data center, you can install a piece of hardware that connects it to the AWS cloud. This is called an *AWS Outpost*.

This is a *hybrid cloud* solution. You have a *private cloud* in your own data center, and a *public cloud* in AWS, and connectivity between the two using a network connection — usually *AWS Managed VPN* or *AWS Direct Connect* will be used for this purpose.

AWS Outposts essentially allows you to extend the functionality of your own data center with AWS services. Only a subset of AWS services are supported however, including:

* EC2
* EBS
* S3
* ECS
* RDS
* EMR
* … and more services will be added with time.

With an Outpost, you can actually deploy VPCs across both your public and private cloud services, and uou can run things like EC2 instances directly on your own hardware.
