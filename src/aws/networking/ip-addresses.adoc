= AWS networking: IP addresses

When we launch instances and other resources into VPC subnets, we assign them IP addresses.

There are three types of IP address in AWS:

* Public IP addresses
* Private IP addresses
* Elastic IP addresses

== Public IP addresses

Public IP addresses are used for resources launched into public subnets. When you launch a resource into a public subnet, AWS will automatically assign a new public IP address to the resource (unless you specify use of an elastic IP address). You don't get any control over which public IP addresses are assigned to your instances â€” it's automatic.

Public IP addresses are used to connect _into_ resources from the internet. They are not used for communication between resources within a VPC, and they are assigned only to resources within public subnets.

Public IP addresses will be lost when the instance is dropped (but they are retained when instances are simply rebooted). Also, public IP addresses cannot be moved from one instance to another.

Public IP addresses are free of charge.

== Private IP addresses

An instance launched into a public subnet has both a public IP address and a private IP address. An instance's public and private IP addresses are associated with each other.

An instance's public IP address is used to communicate with the instance from outside the VPC. It's private IP address is used for communication from other resources within the VPC.

Thus, every resource within a VPC has a private IP address. Instances launched into a private subnet will have only a private IP address, and not a public (or elastic one). You cannot assign public or elastic IP addresses to resources launched into private subnets.

An instance's private IP address is allocated from the CIDR range of the subnet into which it is launched.

As with public IP addresses, an instance's private IP address is retained between restarts.

Private IP addresses are also free of charge.

== Elastic IP addresses

This is Amazon's name for *static public IP addresses*. You rent them from AWS, and they are not automatically assigned to resources. If you assign an elastic IP address to a resource, and then later drop the resource, the elastic IP address will be returned to your account's pool of available elastic IP addresses available. You can then reuse the static IP address for new resources.

With elastic IP addresses, you also have the flexibility to move the addresses between EC2 instances (and also Elastic Network Adapters).

As with standard public IP addresses, static public addresses are associated with the corresponding private IP addresses of the instances to which they are assigned.

You are not charged for _using_ elastic IP address, but you are charged for _not using_ them. This is indented to discourage hoarding of public IPv4 addresses, which are in short supply.

Static IP address can be useful where you want to have a fixed address for a resource, for example for the purpose of allow-listing a resource in a firewall configuration. However, generally you want to avoid depending on static IP address, and instead use DNS names that can be resolved to different addresses.
