== Workspaces

Amazon Workspaces is a managed *Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS)* solution. It allows you to provision Windows or Linux desktops in the cloud, and provide your users with a secure, fast, and reliable desktop experience.

This simplifies delivery of desktops compared to traditional virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployments.

It can be integrated with AWS Managed Microsoft AD.

== AppStream 2.0

This is a fully-managed non-persistent application streaming service. It is an alternative to products like Citrix XenApp. You are streaming individual applications from the cloud (running on a streaming EC2 instance) to a client â€” rather than streaming a whole OS desktop environment.

== WorkLink

This provides a secure, one-click access to your internal websites and web apps using mobile browsers, without needing a VPN client.

== WorkDocs

This is a fully managed, secure content creation, storage, and collaboration service. It allows users to create, edit, and share content that's centrally stored on AWS.
