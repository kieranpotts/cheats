= Serverless services

Serverless services are services in which you don't manage the instances, OSes, or hardware. Therefore, you don't have to worry about availability, fault tolerance, capacity planning, or patching. All of this is handled automatically by the cloud service provider. You just deploy your code.

Serverless services can actually be very cheap. Lambda, for example, is very cost effective for some compute use cases.

Serverless services offered by AWS include:

* Lambda
* Fargate
* EventBridge
* Step Function
* SQS
* SNS
* API Gateway
* S3
* DynamoDB
