= AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)

*Resource Access Manager (RAM)* is a service to share resources across multiple accounts (which may or may not be part of an AWS organization).

The resources that can be shared are:

* AWS Transit Gateways
* Subnets
* AWS License Manager configurations
* Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules

For example, imagine we have an organization with two accounts: a Management Account and a Production Account. In the Management Account we have a public subnet. We can use RAM to share the public subnet with the Production Account, so that the Production Account can also launch EC2 instances into the same public subnet.

Any participants in a shared resource can create, modify, and delete their own resources within the shared resource. However, they cannot view or modify resources that belong to other participants from other accounts.
