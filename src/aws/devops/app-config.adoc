= AppConfig

*AWS AppConfig* is a feature of *AWS Systems Manager* that allows you to create, manage, and deploy application configurations â€” the settings that control the behavior of your applications, and which allow you to adjust application behavior dynamically without deploying new code changes.

AppConfig can be used to implement feature flags and dynamic configurations like throttling limits and logging verbosity.

AppConfig configurations are available to:

* Applications running in EC2 instances (including containerized applications)
* Lambda functions
* Mobile applications
* IoT devices

AppConfig injects configurations into applications at runtime, so you can change application behavior without deploying new code. An alternative approach is to inject configurations at build time. This requires a new deployment to change the configuration. But this would give you a lot more flexibility over where you store your application configurations. You could use, for example, S3, Systems Manager Parameter Store, AWS Secrets Manager, or even secrets stored in GitHub etc.

You can also control how application configurations are deployed to running applications. For example, the following deployment strategies are available:

* `AllAtOnce`: Deploy the configuration to all targets at once.
* `Linear50PercentEvery30Seconds`: Deploy the configuration to 50% of targets every 30 seconds.

Another feature of AppConfig is *validators* to ensure that configuration data is syntactically and semantically correct. Validators are either JSON Schema validators or AWS Lambda validators.
