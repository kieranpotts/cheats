= CloudFormation

*AWS CloudFormation* is an *Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)* solution, similar to Terraform but it is proprietary to AWS.

Infrastructure patterns are defined in a *template* file in JSON or YAML. The file is uploaded to CloudFormation, which will build the infrastructure according to the definitions in the template.

Pretty much every service in AWS can be deployed using CloudFormation.

The core components of this service are:

* *Templates*: The JSON or YAML file that contains the instructions to build out the AWS environment.

* *Stacks*: The entire environment described by the template and created, updated, and deleted as a single unit.

* *Stack Sets*: Extend the functionality of stacks by allowing you to create, update, and delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions.

* *Change Sets*: A summary of proposed changes to your stack that will allow you to see how those changes might impact your existing resources before you apply them.
