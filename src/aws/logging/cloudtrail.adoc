= AWS CloudTrail

This is an *auditing service* — ie. it is all about understanding who did what and when.

CloudTrail logs *API activity* for auditing purposes. Whenever an API call is made in an account, CloudTrail records the details — the user, the resource, the time, etc. This includes calls made via the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, SDKs, and other clients.

By default, management events are logged and retained for 90 days. But if we create a CloudTrail _Trail_, we can capture those events in S3 and retain them indefinitely. A Trail can be within a region, or all regions.

*CloudWatch Events* can be triggered based on API calls made to CloudTrail. So, when we record in CloudTrail a certain event, we can have CloudWatch Events trigger something based on that.

CloudTrail events cna also be streamed to CloudWatch Logs.
