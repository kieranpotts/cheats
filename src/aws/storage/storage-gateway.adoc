= AWS Storage Gateway

*AWS Storage Gateway* is used to connect on-premises applications into proprietary cloud storage using standard protocols. This is known as *hybrid storage*.

Use cases for Storage Gateway include:

* Moving backups into the cloud.
* Using on-premises file shares that get backed up to cloud storage.
* Low latency access to data in AWS from on-premises apps.
* Disaster recovery.

There are three types of Storage Gateway â€” think of these as virtual appliances that you install in your corporate data center, which then connect to AWS Storage Gateway:

* *File Gateway*: A file-based storage system, which uses the NFS or SMB protocols to connect with S3. You can choose from multiple S3 storage classes. Plus, a local cache maintained in your on-premises data center gives you low latency access to recently-used data.

* *Volume Gateway*: This is a block storage system. Your on-premises servers mount a block-based volume, which maps to S3 storage.

* *Backup Gateway*: With this option, application servers have access to either block or file storage protocols via a virtual backup software application, installed locally. The storage volume appears to the client as a virtual tape library, but its actually just another S3 abstraction.
