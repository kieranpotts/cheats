= AWS: Secrets management services

We have a couple of options for storing our secrets — passwords, configuration parameters, or connection strings for databases — in AWS.

*Systems Manager Parameter Store*: This option provides a secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. It is a part of AWS Systems Manager. It is highly scalable, available, and durable. You can store values as plain text (unencrypted) or as ciphertext (ie. encrypted data). You then reference the values by using the unique name that you specify for each stored parameter. Only the parameter names need to be included in your application code; the secure values are fetched at runtime via API calls.

*AWS Secrets Manager* is similar to Parameter Store. It costs a bit more in some cases, but it has some additional features:

* It allows native and automatic rotation of keys.
* Fine-grained permissions.
* Central auditing for secret rotation.
