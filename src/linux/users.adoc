= User management in Linux

== Adding users

To create a new Linux user account, type the following commands, replacing "<username>" with the actual username.

[source]
----
sudo useradd <username>
sudo passwd <username>
----

Create the user's password at the prompt.

The `useradd` command accepts a wide variety of parameters. `-d <home_dir>` sets the user's home directory, which by default would be `/home/<username>`.

[source]
----
useradd -d /home/<custom_dir> <username>
----

To create a user without a home directory (something that you might want to do for security reasons, when the account will be used by a program rather than a human):

[source]
----
useradd -M <username>
----

`-e <date>` sets the date when the account will expire:

[source]
----
useradd -e 2017-12-31 <username>
----

More useful still is a feature that allows you to specify an expiry time for the user's password. User accounts effectively become inactive when their passwords expire, unless an administrator extends the expiry time. The `-f` argument takes an integer for the number of days that the password will remain valid.

[source]
----
useradd -f <time> <username>
----

In Linux, each user has its own UID (Unique Identification Number). By default, the UID is assigned automatically when you create a new user account (starting at UID 500, 501, 502â€¦). Specify the UID with the -u option.

[source]
----
useradd -u 999 <username>
----

Users can be immediately added to one or more groups with the -G option.

[source]
----
useradd -G admins,webmasters,hostmasters <username>
----

The `-c` flag allows you to add comments to a user account. You may use this feature to log a user's full name or employee ID, for example.

[source]
----
useradd -c "Any comment here" <username>
----

Finally, sometimes you will create user accounts that will not be used for the purpose of logging in. You can assign different shells to users, and in the following example the user account is given the `/sbin/nologin` shell.

[source]
----
useradd -s /sbin/nologin <username>
----

=== Modifying user accounts

To rename a user:

[source]
----
sudo usermod -l <new-username> <old-username>
----

The `usermod` command accepts the same parameters as `useradd`. To change a user's password, run `passwd`.

To change the user's home directory and move all the files over from the old home directory:

[source]
----
sudo usermod -d /home/<new-home-dir> -m <new-username>
----

After this command, you can delete the user's old home directory.

[source]
----
sudo rm -rf /home/<old-home-dir>
----

== Deleting users

Use the following command to delete user accounts. The `-r` flag removes the user's home directory, too.

[source]
----
sudo userdel -r <username>
----

== Groups

In Linux, user groups are a way of organizing users. Group membership is administered through the `/etc/group` file. To create a new user group, use the `groupadd` command.

[source]
----
sudo groupadd <group_name>
----

Example:

[source]
----
sudo groupadd webmasters
----

To add a user to a group:

[source]
----
sudo usermod -G <group_name> <username>
----

To list all users in a group:

[source]
----
getent group <group_name>
----

To rename a user group:

[source]
----
sudo groupmod -n <newname> <oldname>
----

Every user has a default or primary group, which is what they join automatically when they login. When a user creates a file or launches a program, the file or the running process will be associated with the user's current group membership. To create files or run programs in a different group, the user must first call `chgrp` to switch to another group (of which they must be a member).

[source]
----
chgrp <groupname>
----

The `newgrp` command has the same effect and works in the same way.

== Sudoers

If the user will need root-level privileges, add the user to the sudoers group. In Ubuntu, this group is appropriately called "sudo", while in CentOS it is known as the "wheel" group.

[source]
----
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
sudo usermod -aG wheel <username>
----

Limited user accounts that are part of the sudo/wheel group can switch to full administrator privileges by prepending administrator commands with "sudo":

[source]
----
sudo <command>
----

Or, to switch to the root user for the remainder of the session:

[source]
----
sudo su -
----

To logout of the root user account and return to your own, type `logout`.

The sudoers file at `/etc/sudoers` provides a list of users that have root-level privileges. The file should not be edited directly with a text editor because if you make a mistake with the configuration you could lock out all users from the box entirely. Instead, use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers configuration.

For security, all `sudo` commands require password entry to confirm the action. To receive an email whenever someone uses `sudo`, you will need to extend the sudoers configuration. Again, rather than edit the `/etc/sudoers` file directly, you should create an extension file in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory. Any files in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory will be automatically included and will extend the default configuration from `/etc/sudoers`.

Create a new file at `/etc/sudoers.d/sudoers`:

[source]
----
sudo nvim /etc/sudoers.d/sudoers
----

Add the following lines to the file:

----
Defaults    mail_always
Defaults    mailto="<email_address>"
----

Close and save the file, then set permissions on the file:

[source]
----
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/sudoers
----

You'll need to install a mail server application if you have not already. `sendmail` is as good as any. Use the `yum` or `apt` package managers to install it.

Test the configuration by running some commands with `sudo`. Just listing the contents of the current directory should be enough to trigger the email alert.

[source]
----
sudo ls -lha
----
