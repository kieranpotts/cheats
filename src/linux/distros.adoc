= Linux distributions

Try the following commands to find the distro name and version number:

[source]
----
cat /etc/*-release
lsb_release -a
hostnamectl
----

Reading the `/etc/*-release` files produces at least some useful information on all distros. The `lsb_release` command displays certain Linux Standard Base (LSB) and distribution-specific information. The `hostnamectl` works for GNU systemd-based  distros.
