== `upstream` versus `location`

The `location` block is used to match expressions and create rules for them.

[source]
----
location ~ \.php$ {
  try_files      $uri = 404;
  fastcgi_pass   unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
  fastcgi_index  index.php;
  include        fastcgi.conf;
}
----

`upstream` defines servers that can be referenced to. In the following example, the `factcgi_pass` setting is replaced by a reference to the `php` server, defined by the earlier `upstream` block.

[source]
----
upstream php {
  server         unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
}

location ~ \.php$ {
  try_files      $uri = 404;
  fastcgi_pass   php;
  fastcgi_index  index.php;
  include        fastcgi.conf;
}
----

The benefit of using `upstream` blocks is that you can configure more than one server/port/service as upstream, and distribute traffic across the servers. Example:

[source]
----
upstream php {
  server 127.0.0.1:8080   max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
  server 192.68.1.2       weight=5;
  server                  unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;
}
