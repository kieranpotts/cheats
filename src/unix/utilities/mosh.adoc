= `mosh`

Mosh can be used to SSH into a remote server. It's unique selling point is that it supports mobile roaming by keeping the connection alive when the client IP address changes â€“ as happens when you switch from Wi-Fi to a mobile data connection. Mosh needs to be installed on both the client and server, which is how it maintains connection state.
