= `moreutils`

https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/[`moreutils`] is "a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write long ago when unix was young". Bundled utilities include:

* `ts` adds timestamps to standard output.
* `errno <code>` tells you what the error code means.
* `ifdata` prints information about your network interfaces.
* `vidir` can be used to edit directory names in your text editor.
* `vipe` allows you to insert your text editor into a pipeline, allowing you to edit the data that is being piped between two programs.
