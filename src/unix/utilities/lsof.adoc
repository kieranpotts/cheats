= `lsof`

https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsof.8.html[`lsof`] – "list open files" – is shipped with many Unix systems by default. It outputs a list of all open files and the processes that opened them.

It can also be used to identify the processes that own a particular port:

----
$ lsof -i :22
----
