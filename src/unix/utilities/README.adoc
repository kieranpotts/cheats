= Unix utilities

I'm defining utility software as any simple computer program with only a command line interface and which specializes in a single discrete task. Many of these utilities are commonly shipped with Linux distributions (some like `su` being integrated into the Linux kernel) and other Unix-like operating systems, though they are not part of the Single Unix Specification (SUS).
