= `whereis`

Locates the binary, source, and manual pages for a given command.Searches a predefined set of directories, not just $PATH.

----
$ whereis <command>
----

Example:

----
$ whereis gcc
gcc: /usr/bin/gcc /usr/share/man/man1/gcc.1.gz
----

`whereis` searches for more things than link:./which.adoc[`which`], which just looks for binaries. It is much faster than `find`, which searches the entire filesystem, but is also less flexible and less powerful.
