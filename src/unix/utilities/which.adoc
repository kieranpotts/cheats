= `which`

Finds the location of an executable that would be run if you typed the first argument as a command in the shell. Searches the directories listed in your PATH environment variable.

----
$ which <command>
----

Example:

----
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
----

`which` only finds executables. It is useful for debugging PATH issues. To find more things about a program – not only its binary but also its source and manual pages – use link:./whereis.adoc[`whereis`].
