= `shred`

`rm` does not actually remove a file, it just removes the reference to it in the filesystem ("unlinking"). The data is still there until it is overwritten by new data.

`shred` overwrites the file with random data – over multiple passes – before deleting the link, making it much harder to recover the deleted data.
