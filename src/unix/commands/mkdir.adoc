= `mkdir`

----
mkdir <directory_name>
----

If creating nested directories, you can use the `-p` option to automatically create all parent directories recursively, as needed:

----
mkdir -pr <dir-one>/<dir-two>/<dir-three>
----

To make a directory and set permissions at the same time:

----
mkdir -m a=rwx <directory_name>
----

The `-m` option is short for "mode", and `a=rwx` means that all users have read, write, and execute permissions on the directory.
