= cat

The `cat` command is used to combine files or to print the content of files to the screen. By default, the `cat` command sends its output to `stdout`.

.Example: view the content of the `.profile` file

----
cat .profile

If the file is very large or is not a plain text file, `cat` will still try to output its contents fully. The `less` command is better suited for this purpose.

The `cat` utility can be used with the Unix shell's output redirection operators to join multiple files into a single one. The following command copies the contents of the files `input1` and `input2` to a file called `output`.

cat input1 input2 > output

The `>>` operator is used for appending to the end of an existing file:

----
cat input >> output
