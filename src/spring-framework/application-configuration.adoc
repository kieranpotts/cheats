= Spring: Application configuration

Spring Boot simplifies many fo the necessary configurations required to build a Spring application. Configuration files are named `application.properties` or `application.yml` and they allow developers to set properties that control behaviors of the application, such as:

* *Server configuration*: The default port, session settings, and other server parameters.

* *Database parameters*: Connection properties and connection pool size.

* *Logging levels*: Adjust logging detail between environments.
