= Dockerizing Java applications

== Run a basic Java container

This is useful for just experimenting with Java code in a containerized environment, so you don't need to install a Java runtime directly on your host machine.

[source,java]
----
docker pull openjdk:22-jdk

# Run the container in detached interactive mode:
docker run -dit openjdk:22-jdk

# If you run the container in interactive mode in the
# foreground, jshell will be elevated to your terminal.
# (Type `/exit` to exit jshell but keep the container running).
docker run -it openjdk:22-jdk
